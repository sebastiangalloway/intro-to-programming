1. Programming is "CAFO" - Coding Around and Finding Out.
    - You will need to spend time thinking, but you can do that while coding. 
    - Nobody is watching you. They don't ever need to know how "dumb" you were until you found "smart".
    - Know when to stop "googling" and start coding.
    - Coding Assitants can help but ALWAYS be skeptical of what they suggest. It might be right, but if you don't understand it, it is still wrong.


2. Be Trustworthy.
    - "RUG" - repeat until good. You are writing code to clarify your understanding. Rarely will that happen immediately.
        - The teacher/video/tutorial paradox.
            - Did I really "live code" this class? Nah. I mean *some*, but nah.
    - Don't lend people stuff that isn't good. And it won't be good for a long time sometimes.
        - "Never type private, always refactor to it"
        - The "shared" folder is a huge responsibility. 
    - Write tests that show more WHAT your code does than HOW it does it.
        - You will need to change the HOW frequently, but the WHAT needs to be more stable.


3. Communicate
    - You will be working in a team with diffuse borders. 
    - Learn to talk about code and software.
    - Consider "TDR"s - if not in the team repo, at least for yourself.
    - Consider "let me teach you how I'm doing this" as a way to find the problems in what you are doing.
        - "Here's what I'm trying to accomplish - can I walk you through what I was thinking here?" instead of
          "how do I do X?" or "it's broke. help".
        - Everyone else is working on their own things, too. Sometimes they know the "secret key" you are missing.

4. Loose Coupling / High Cohesion
    - A fancy way of saying "I'm doing my best here, and here is what I'm trying to do"
    - "Quiet Quitting" as a virtue. Trust that working to the requirement is enough.
        - "YAGNI" - You Aren't Going to Need It. 

5. "I don't work best under pressure, I ONLY work under pressure"
    - The ADHD motto.
    - Learn to ship code that works. This is more important than shipping code that is "perfect".
    - Write "disposable code" until it's clear.
    - Prioritize based on your skills. "What can I bring to this that will allow the company to get the most value from ME".
    
6. Learning is your job. 
    - Learning what people already know.
    - Learning what nobody knows. "Finding out".
